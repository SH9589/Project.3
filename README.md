# Jarvis AI Assistant

A multi-modal AI assistant that can interact through voice, recognize faces, understand images, and provide visual output.

## Features

- Voice Interaction
  - Speech-to-Text for voice commands
  - Text-to-Speech for responses
- Computer Vision
  - Face detection and recognition
  - Object detection
  - Live camera feed
- Image Processing
  - Image analysis
  - Visual question answering
  - Image display capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam
- Microphone
- GPU (recommended for better performance)

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Additional setup for face recognition:
- Install dlib (follow platform-specific instructions)
- Install face_recognition library

## Usage

Run the assistant:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Voice Commands

- "Show camera feed" - Display live camera feed
- "Hide camera feed" - Hide camera feed
- "Who do you see?" - Identify recognized faces
- "What objects do you see?" - Detect objects in view
- "Analyze image [path]" - Analyze specified image
- "Exit" - Close the assistant
